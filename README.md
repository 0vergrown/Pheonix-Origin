# Pheonix Origin - Origins (Fabric) For Minecraft 1.18
Who would I be if I didn't do the clichÃ© Phoenix Origin? Okay, so I tired to make mine differ from other phoenixes but in reality there's not much difference when it comes to other people's phoenix. There's a high chance that I'll come back to this one and make it more unique but this was one of the first Origins that I made and I wanted to share as a way to sort of compare it with my other Origins and see how far I've come from this one.

Pheonix datapack is made for the fabric mod, [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins). You must have it for this pack to work.

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

Icon: Magma Cream <br />
Impact: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ <br />
Description: A long-lived, immortal bird. Your wings powers have been long sought after by many through time. You've lived for decades, and will probably be here after everyone else is gone.

*Positive ðŸŸ¢:*

- **Gift Of Flame:** Propels you the direction you're looking at. (Primary)
- **Fire Shot:** You are able to shoot fireballs as a defense mechanism. (Secondary)
- **Extra Hearts:** Because of your lineage, you get 5 more hearts.
- **Fire Body:** Your body is made up of flames, so it is immune to fire and lava.
- **Fire Strength:** Because of your lineage and body, you are much stronger when on fire.
- **Winged Creature:** As a phoenix, you are naturally born with wings.

*Neutral ðŸŸ¡:*

- **Phoenix Body:** Your body has an orange tint. (Hidden)
- **Fire Particles:** Small flames expel from your body. (Hidden)
- **Lava Vision:** You can see in lava.
- **Fire Home:** Because of your body and the flames that surround you, your spawn is the Nether.

*Negative ðŸ”´:*

- **Hydrophobic:** Despite being used your travels, large amounts of water will sear your fiery flesh. You take damage from all water sources.
- **Light Armor Only:** You struggle to stay afloat when you're wearing heavy armor. Because of this, you've decided that you will only wear light armor. (Anything that's less or equal to chainmail)
- **More Fall Damage:** You've had long travels and have lived for a long time, your body isn't what it used to be so you take more fall damage.
- **No Iron:** Because your body is made out of fire, iron melts in your hand to the point of nothing. You can not pickup any iron items and if they get into your inventory, they will be disintegrated and be lost forever.
